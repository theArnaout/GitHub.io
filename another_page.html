                    <h1>Other Page: More About Me</h1>
                        <p>While attending school for Marketing I decided to become a
                            personal trainer. I did that for a few years before going
                            into personal training sales and then later moving into 
                            a district sales management role in retail. I also opened
                            my own business making and selling fitness equipment.
                    
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite most of my adult job experience being outside
                            of computers and programming, I was exposed to a fair
                            bit of computers while growing up. When I was around 
                            eleven years old, I worked at a local computer repair
                            shop during my summer break. During this period I 
                            attempted to make my own games but was not very successful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next time I fiddled with coding was when I started my 
                            business on Shopify. Shopify has many tools that make it 
                            easy to start a website without prior coding knowledge but,
                            the ability to customize and actually make your website 
                            function the way you imagine was still difficult. So, I 
                            tried to learn different ways to do them manually. While
                            only partially successful, it did give me a very basic 
                            taste of what coding was like.
